# ansible_concepts_practise

Bought below course from Udemy for learning and practising Ansible concepts:

Complete Ansible Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Ansible  by abdennour

Was very engaging and a practical course to learn the concepts and practically experience the concepts in AWS environment.

I deplooyed all the learnings from my local machine to AWS servers. 

Deployed docker containers, kubernetes.

Many Concepts such as below were thought and explained practically:

-- define variables and different ways to defien the variables
-- Rollback from  recent changes, by using CICD process and github branches.
-- Register concepts, passing variables at runtime by assigning value to variables using registers.
-- ansible_facts is a parent variable which is default stored in ansible. 
	- gathered_facts consists of all details of all the remote host and can be used as variables
-- runtime variables or magic variables:
-- loop module to iterate values
-- when condition
-- delegate_to module
-- jinja filters
-- template module for copying jinja files
-- ansible vault for encryption
-- dyanmic inventory
-- ansible galaxy
-- ansible roles
-- running playbook with tags
-- import modules


Finally did a capstone project of deploying a 3 tire todo application involving react.js as the frontend, golang as the backend application server and mongodb as the database.

Deployed this application using ansible playbooks, was a good learning and real time experience.
